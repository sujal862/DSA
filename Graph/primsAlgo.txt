DS - Visited set, priority_queue<pair>, unorderd_map

- insert the pair of < -1, src > in the pq.
- one by one remove the root element of the pq.
- if the root elememt is already visited, then we will just continue.
- we mark the root visited // pq sa nikalta sma hum visited mark kr rha (final answer ma jayga wo)
- we store the wt of the pair in the ans
- update the mapping
- go to every neibhour of the curr element, and  only add those which are non visited and have a 
    better wt proposition
 



 # reason of Now, from all vertices already in MST, choose the minimum edge going outside:
 - minimum edge har bar pick karne se hum koi dusra already visited node ko ek optimal minimum weight ke through visit kar sakte hai, right
